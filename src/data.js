    title: "Transforming FBR",
    description:"Huzaima Bukhari, Dr. Ikramul Haq & Abdul Rauf Shakoori In the light of dynamic shifts in business and advancements in technology, it is opportune for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to get on a transformation journey. This entails updating its tax administration framework to enhance efficiency and tackle challenges like evasion and counterfeiting. Embracing digital solutions can be important in overcoming these hurdles and promoting transparency in tax processes. By harnessing modern technology, the FBR can streamline operations and fortify its revenue collection efforts. This evolution is essential for aligning with the evolving business environment and unlocking maximum revenue potential. In order to achieve these objectives, proactive steps must be taken to implement innovative solutions and optimize tax management practices. Through such endeavours, the FBR can position itself as a forward-thinking, people-friendly and service-oriented institution adept at meeting the demands of the modern economy. An exemplary endeavour by the FBR is the Track & Trace system (TTS), aimed at monitoring goods’ supply at all points and tax compliance. Initially implemented in key sectors like sugar, tobacco, fertilizer, and cement, TTS ensures accurate tax payments. This system meticulously tracks the production and distribution of goods, ensuring tax adherence at every stage. With TTS, the FBR aims to enhance transparency and combat tax evasion effectively. The implementation of the TTS by the FBR represents a significant step towards modernizing tax administration. Through this system, taxable goods are endowed with Unique Identification Markings such as barcodes and QR codes, embedding crucial data like origin, manufacturer, and tax information. Furthermore, the system incorporates high-security physical tax stamps on unit packets to bolster tax verification and product authentication efforts."

    title: "Taxes for growth & prosperity",
    description:"Dr. Ikramul Haq and Abdul Rauf Shakoori Fiscal balances improved on the back of strong budget execution and revenue performance. The general government achieved a primary surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP in FY24H1, exceeding projections by 0.4 percent of GDP, driven by strong PDL, excise, and direct tax revenues, which offset lower-than-expected import-related revenues and SBP profits. Federal current spending matched program forecasts, but federal PSDP was significantly under-executed. Provincial overspending was only PRs 136 billion in FY24H1, as Punjab’s total expenditures in FY24Q2 were curtailed to partially offset an earlier overrun. 4 Other provinces’ PSDP is anticipated to remain close to SBA projections given the government’s constraints and the time required for the new government to develop new schemes—IMF Country Report No. 24/105 – May 10, 2024"

    title: "Reform agenda for 2024 budget",
    description:"Dr. Ikramul Haq & Abdul Rauf Shakoori The federal government is expected to present budget 2024 for the fiscal year (FY) 2024-25 on June 7, 2024. This will be the first budget of the government of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN) after coming into power in the wake of general elections of February 8, 2024. It is led by the second time elect Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif, who earlier served under 16-month tenure of Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) that began after ousting Prime Minister Imran Khan through a first time successful vote of no confidence in Pakistan’s history on April 9, 2022."

    title: "NAB & Judiciary",
    description:"Who will mind the minders? Dr. Ikramul Haq & Abdul Rauf Shakoori A fair and effective accountability mechanism is essential for ensuring progress and stability, serving as the foundation for any governance system. Such mechanisms are vital for rooting out corruption, fostering transparency, and building trust in public institutions. However, in Pakistan, the accountability system is mostly compromised, failing to deliver its intended objectives. Unlike other state institutions designed to aid in governance and service delivery, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was established with an agenda that deviated from these principles. Instead of focusing solely on promoting accountability and integrity, NAB is perceived as a tool for political gerrymandering, and victimization of public office holders. This has undermined its credibility and effectiveness."

    description:"Huzaima Bukhari, Dr. Ikramul Haq & Abdul Rauf Shakoori Pakistan is persistently confronting economic challenges, the resolution of which hinge on IMF’s new program, future conditions and Pakistan’s adherence to them with the hope of regaining the path to economic prosperity. If secured, this would mark Pakistan’s third IMF program since 2019. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth $6 billion later extended to $7 billion ended prematurely in June 2023. Subsequently, on Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif’s request, Pakistan signed a $3 billion standby arrangement (SBA) in July 2023. Now, negotiations are underway for a new agreement with the IMF."

    title: "Budget, taxes & growth",
    description:"Dr. Ikramul Haq & Abdul Rauf Shakoori Pakistan, while in the grip of severe fiscal challenges, is making preparations, under the tight control of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), for presenting the federal budget 2024 in the National Assembly on June 7, 2024. The government is apprehending a huge budget deficit leaving it with little financial room to offer much-needed relief to its citizens and businesses. Consequently, there is a pervasive sense of pessimism surrounding the upcoming federal budget in which many preconditions of IMF are to be incorporated. The only expected silver lining might be avoiding additional burdens on the existing taxpayers by widening the tax net and identifying new sources of revenue."
